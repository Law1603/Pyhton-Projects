## What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height. It provides a rough estimate of whether a person has a healthy body weight for a person of their height. Depending on the BMI value, a person can fall into one of the following categories:
- **Underweight:** BMI is less than 18.5
- **Normal weight:** BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
- **Overweight:** BMI is 25 to 34.9
- **Severely Obese:** BMI is 35 and above

## Note

This script showcases basic Python programming skills, user input handling, and conditional logic. It's a simple representation of how one can build user-friendly tools to process and interpret data.
